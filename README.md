them consists of a product and number of items. Products and cases have dimensions: x, y, and z.
Assume that they have a shape of a rectangle (boxes).
As a result please, provide the chosen cases, their number, and the total price of packing. The optimality
of a solution is determined by available empty space in boxes and the total price of the shipment.
